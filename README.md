# SpriteFilter

This is part of a collection of [tools](https://github.com/fatmanspanda/ALttPNG/releases) designed to facilitate spriting for The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past on the SNES.

[SpriteFilter](https://github.com/fatmanspanda/ALttPNG/wiki/Sprite-Filter) imports `.spr` files, applies any one of a number of atrocious filters, and then exports to a new `.spr` for importing into roms.
